To build libdwarf.a, type
        ./configure
        make


This implementation of libdwarf is not complete.  Among the
missing features are consumer support for .debug_macinfo and
support for .debug_loc.  Some paths have not yet been tested.

In general, in the producer code, 
numbers are copied from and to integers
with memcpy().  In case of endianness problems,
constants set in dwarf_producer_init() can fix the problems.
If one wants to produce a *different-endian* output
the best solution is to change the integer memcpy calls
to call thru a new dbg-based function pointer and
have it 'do the right thing' to adjust endianness.
Set the function pointer correctly in dwarf_producer_init()
and the rest of the code will just call thru the function
pointer.  Tedious work to find and change the memcpy
calls to be dbg->de_memcpy(), but once done the
code is no longer endian dependent (right now there is 
no way to ask for cross-endian: a new flag needed or ?).

leb128 numbers are endian-independent, so nothing need be
done with those for cross-endian support (the storage
of leb128 on disk is always little-endian).

The .ps files are postscript. So those who cannot deal with mm
format files but do have a postscript printer can print the
documents.

libdwarf2.1.ps documents a way for a debugger to read dwarf information.
libdwarf2p.1.ps documents a way for a compiler to generate dwarf information.
dwarf.v2.ps documents Dwarf Version 2.
index.v2.ps is an index to dwarf.v2.ps.
indexDW.v2  is a plain text index of dwarf #defines to dwarf.v2.ps
mips_extensions.ps documents the mips/sgi extensions to dwarf.

The commands used to generate the postscript were:
 pr -t -e libdwarf2.1.mm | tbl | psroff -t -mm >libdwarf2.1.ps
 pr -t -e  libdwarf2p.1.mm | tbl | psroff -t -mm >libdwarf2p.1.ps
 pic dwarf.v2.mm | tbl | psroff -t -mm >dwarf.v2.ps 2> newIndex
 pic index.v2.mm | tbl | psroff -t -mm >index.v2.ps

pic is a picture processing tool (ATT command).
tbl is a table-processing tool.
(part of Documentor's Work Bench on ATT-like systems).
tbl and pic are available on linux.

psroff is a name for a troff-like processor, part of
Documentor's Work Bench on IRIX. Substitute a
troff-like or nroff-like processor.

The index.v2.mm was generated by the dwarf-document writer
using some local ATT/USL tools (which SGI does not have, so
there is no way to regenerate this).

To use dwarf or libdwarf, you may want to install dwarf.h and
libdwarf.h somewhere convenient.
