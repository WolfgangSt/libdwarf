Stan Shebs (shebs@cygnus.com) pointed out that the pro_util.h
use of R_MIPS* was a problem compiling on Sun.
Since the producer code is not really used at present except for
MIPS/sgi, I've added #ifndefs to pro_util.h which provide zero values
when <elf.h> does not provide the macros.
When anyone needs the producer code to actually *work* for non-MIPS
something better will have to be done.

This has no effect on those simply compiling libdwarf for 
use by dwarfdump.

Changed the READ_UNALAGNED macro to call a function
depending on endianness of the host and the object being read.
So all the dwarf_* source changed in a trivial way.
Added support for printing egcs eh_frame section.
Added a local memcpy-like function to do the cross-endian
thing where applicable (called by READ_UNALIGNED macro). 
Because the .eh_frame section 
after linking can have some zeroed out bytes at the
end of the CIE/FDE data the code looking for CIEs and FDEs
now assumes a zero CIE/FDE length means it has reached
the end of the CIE/FDE data.

1999 June 14
  Fred Fish fnf@ninemoons.com contributed
  autoconf'ing of the libdwarf and dwarfdump source.  
  

  mips_extensions.*  Documented additional old errors
  in the Dwarf Version 2 spec.

  The ChangeLog before this is incomplete. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
Since Oct 95 and before May, 1996 davea@sgi.com David Anderson

Added the function dwarf_get_cie_of_fde() which makes it possible
to remember a single fde/cie set out of a block usefully.

Enhanced doc of dwarf_bitoffset()

Added new function dwarf_global_formref() so all reference
forms can be retrieved.

Fixed bug in retrieving array bounds: was failing to sign extend
formsdata.

Added function dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs(), which makes
retrieval of the complete set of registers (as needed by
debuggers and exception handlers) effectively N times faster
than getting them one a time where N is the number of registers.

Added support for exception table handling (really just support
for a reference to an exception table for c++ exceptions).

Fixed a bug where useless extra space (several megabytes)
were malloc'ed for the abbreviations table by the libdwarf
consumer code.
