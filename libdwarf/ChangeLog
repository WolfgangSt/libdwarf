      * dwarf_print_lines.c pro_section.c dwarf_query.c
        dwarf_alloc.c dwarf_arange.c dwarf_sort_line.c
        dwarf_global.c dwarf_line.c dwarf_abbrev.c
        dwarf_frame2.c dwarf_util.c dwarf_loc.c dwarf_util.h 
        dwarf_die_deliv.c dwarf_frame.c dwarf_macro.c: Additions
        to source for year 2007 now fit in with pre-existing 
        copyright wording.  Effectively no change.
      * dwarf_srclines_dealloc.c: Now has the (always-intended) SGI
        LGPL copyright wording.
2007-04-09 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net
      * dwarf_error.h: Add DW_DLE_LINK_LOOP error code (Sun).
      * libdwarf.h: Add DW_DLE_LINK_LOOP error code (Sun).
      * dwarf.h: Incorporate Sun extensions. Thanks to
        Chris Quenelle at Sun Microsystems.
2007-04-06 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net
      * dwarf_sort_line.c (_dwarf_update_line_sec): initialize
        Dwarf_Debug_s struct. Thanks to Chris Quenelle of Sun Microsystems.
        Also initialize other local variables.
2007-04-02 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net
      * dwarf_form.c (dwarf_formsdata, dwarf_formudata): Use
        Dwarf_sfixed in dwarf_formsdata, document need for casts,
        Use Dwarf_Signed as type for READ_UNALIGNED macro use.
        The only real correction here is for a 64bit long compiled 
        libdwarf reading 32bit dwarf_formsdata FORM_data4.
      * dwarf_base_types.h: Now Dwarf_sfixed64 and Dwarf_ufixed64
        are properly declared (so they are usable).
2007-03-11 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net
      * Makefile.in: use groff to produce postscript.
      * libdwarf2.1.mm libdwarf2.1.ps  libdwarf2p.1.mm
        libdwarf2p.1.ps: Clean up the introduction and history.
        Add a non-restrictive copyright notice.
2007-02-23 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net
      * dwarf_util.h: now the macros use do{} while(0)
      * pro_forms.c dwarf_print_lines.c pro_section.c dwarf_query.c 
        dwarf_arange.c dwarf_sort_line.c dwarf_global.c dwarf_line.c
        dwarf_abbrev.c dwarf_frame2.c dwarf_util.c dwarf_loc.c
        dwarf_die_deliv.c dwarf_frame.c: Now have ;
        after all dwarf_util.h macros. Also added local variable
        initializations (compiler noticed).
      * dwarf_macro.c: was missing include of <stdlib.h> for free() 
        declaration. 
      * dwarf_print_lines.c pro_section.c dwarf_query.c dwarf_alloc.c
        dwarf_arange.c dwarf_sort_line.c dwarf_global.c dwarf_line.c
        dwarf_abbrev.c dwarf_srclines_dealloc.c dwarf_frame2.c
        dwarf_util.c dwarf_loc.c dwarf_die_deliv.c dwarf_frame.c
        dwarf_macro.c: indent run with standard libdwarf options.

2007-02-20 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net
      * dwarf_macro.c  (dwarf_get_macro_details): Now call
        dwarf_free_macro_stack() at every return so no data
        is leaked and there is no longer any global data
        (restoring thread safety).
2007-02-09 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net
      * dwarf_line.c (dwarf_srclines): Added in calls
        to dwarf_free_line_table_prefix() which were omitted
        by accident.  Thanks to  Cristian Vlasceanu for noticing.
