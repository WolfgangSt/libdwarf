      * dwarf_macro.c  (dwarf_get_macro_details): Now call
        dwarf_free_macro_stack() at every return so no data
        is leaked and there is no longer any global data
        (restoring thread safety).

      * dwarf_line.c (dwarf_srclines): Added in calls
        to dwarf_free_line_table_prefix() which were omitted
        by accident.  Thanks to  Cristian Vlasceanu for noticing.
