      * dwarf_util.h: now the macros use do{} while(0)
      * pro_forms.c dwarf_print_lines.c pro_section.c dwarf_query.c 
        dwarf_arange.c dwarf_sort_line.c dwarf_global.c dwarf_line.c
        dwarf_abbrev.c dwarf_frame2.c dwarf_util.c dwarf_loc.c
        dwarf_die_deliv.c dwarf_frame.c: Now have ;
        after all dwarf_util.h macros. Also added local variable
        initializations (compiler noticed).
      * dwarf_macro.c: was missing include of <stdlib.h> for free() 
        declaration. 
      * dwarf_print_lines.c pro_section.c dwarf_query.c dwarf_alloc.c
        dwarf_arange.c dwarf_sort_line.c dwarf_global.c dwarf_line.c
        dwarf_abbrev.c dwarf_srclines_dealloc.c dwarf_frame2.c
        dwarf_util.c dwarf_loc.c dwarf_die_deliv.c dwarf_frame.c
        dwarf_macro.c: indent run with standard libdwarf options.

      * dwarf_macro.c  (dwarf_get_macro_details): Now call
        dwarf_free_macro_stack() at every return so no data
        is leaked and there is no longer any global data
        (restoring thread safety).

      * dwarf_line.c (dwarf_srclines): Added in calls
        to dwarf_free_line_table_prefix() which were omitted
        by accident.  Thanks to  Cristian Vlasceanu for noticing.
