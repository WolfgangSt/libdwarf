        dwarf_original_elf_init.c: Remove __SGI_FAST_LIBELF
        and fix some indentation botches.
      * dwarf_init_finish.c: Fix typo in variable name introduced
        a few days ago.
      * dwarf_elf_access.c:  Remove __SGI_FAST_LIBELF

2008-05-20  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf_init_finish.c: Expand tabs to spaces.
2008-05-20  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf_init_finish.c(dwarf_object_init): When there is no 
        DWARF information return DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY gracefully.
        Thanks to Carlos Alberto Enciso for pointing out
        the bug.
2008-04-12  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * pro_section.c: Initialize local variables to zero.
        Change leading tabs to spaces.
      * pro_reloc_stream.c: Initialize local variables to zero.
        Change leading tabs to spaces.
      * pro_reloc.c: Initialize local variables to zero.
        Change leading tabs to spaces.
2008-04-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf_base_types.h: Removed unused macro definition.
      * dwarf_util.c: Altered abbreviations hash table for a small
        performance improvement and space saving.
      * dwarf_util.h: Changed declaration for space saving in dwarf
        abbreviations table.
2008-04-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h: A trivial change to make a declaration look better.
      * dwarf_abbrev.h: We record tags in more than 16 bits now just in case
        we encounter such a thing (increased ab_tag field size), though
        we should not find such.
      * dwarf_abbrev.c: Adding a comment about the dwarf TAG value.
      * dwarf_util.c: Initialize local variables at declaration for safety.
        Removed truncation of some values: internally record more bits.
        Rewrote handling of the abbrev table as the old one did not scale
        to large numbers of abbreviations (things got very slow).
      * dwarf_util.h: Now has a larger field size in the argument to
        _dwarf_get_abbrev_for_code (not quite necessary but not harmful).
      * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Initializing local variables at declaration and
        removing truncation of bits from some uleb values.
      * dwarf_die_deliv.h: Increased size of ab_code field.
      * dwarf_opaque.h: Added a comment about abbreviations.
      * dwarf_base_types.h: Revised to match addition of new
        allocation table entry.
      * dwarf_alloc.h: Document macro definitions and increase one to
        match new table size.
      * dwarf_alloc.c: Arrange handling of new DW_DLA_HASH_TABLE_ENTRY
        (most of the work done in dwarf_util.c).
2008-02-27  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h: Fixed minor typo in latest libdwarf.h that gcc did not 
        complain about. Noted by Josh Fuhs.
2008-02-26  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf_alloc.h: Add comment giving placement of DWARF_SIMPLE_MALLOC.
      * pro_opaque.h: Remove de_access field, it is never used.
      * libdwarf.h: Add new data structures to allow reading of
        non-Elf object files.
      * dwarf_original_elf_init.c: dwarf_init(), dwarf_elf_init()
        moved here from dwarf_init_finish.c.
      * Makefile.in: Build new source files dwarf_original_elf_init.c
        and dwarf_elf_access.c.
      * dwarf_init_finish.c: All dependencies on libelf and elf
        have been removed.
      * dwarf_opaque.h: The elf related info is removed and Dwarf_Debug_s
        now contains a new structure (from libdwarf.h) to hide object
        information.
      * dwarf_elf_access.c: All the Elf-using code is now in this
        source file and elf details are kept in a struct defined and
        used here.   Non-libelf and non-elf object access code would
        write a new source file with their own details using this
        as an example.
      * dwarf_elf_access.h: Prototypes for calling between
        dwarf_original_elf_init.c and dwarf_elf_access.c.
2008-02-18  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h: Declare new object-access functions and structures.
      * dwarf_original_elf_init.c: Traditional dwarf_init() and dwarf_elf_init()
        are moved to this new source file.
      * Makefile.in: Add new source files.
      * dwarf_init_finish.c: Now uses the function pointers, not
        libelf specific fields or ifdefs.
      * pro_opaque.h:  Remove de_access field, it is unused.
      * dwarf_opaque.h: New fields for new object-access functions.
      * dwarf_elf_access.c: New implementation details for elf access functions
        moved here from dwarf_init_finish.c.
      * dwarf_elf_access.h: New function interface so  dwarf_elf_access.c
        and dwarf_original_elf_init.c can communicate.
2008-02-08  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_print_lines.c: Added commentary to clarify that
       dwarf_print_lines() and _dwarf_print_lines are intentionally
       identical.  Initialized local variables so they are alll
       visibly set to some sensible value.
2008-02-07  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_frame.c (_dwarf_fde_section_offset): A typo
       in the last release made this an infinite loop.
       A one character change fixed it. Thanks to Carlos Alberto
       Enciso for noticing the bug.
2008-02-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_incl.h, pro_incl.h: Moved #include of dwarf.h before libdwarf.h
     * pro_forms.c: Some newer attributes are now handled.
     * dwarf_print_lines.c: Removed unused #include.
     * dwarf_sort_line.c: Removed alloca use in favor of
       malloc and removed the alloca #include.
     * dwarf_line.c: Removed unused #include.
     * dwarf_line2.c: Removed unused #include.

2008-02-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Fix commentary mistakes.
2008-02-02  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Add DW_DLC_OFFSET_SIZE_64 for run-time
       selection of DWARF3 64bit extension producer offset generation.
     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Document DW_DLC_OFFSET_SIZE_64.
     * pro_init.c (dwarf_producer_init): Now standard DWARF3 is the default.
     * configure.in: Add --enable-dwarf-format-sgi-irix for those
       wanting IRIX offset-style DWARF2. Add --enable-dwarf-format-strict-32bit
       for those wanting strictly 32bit offsets.
       Otherwise default to generating 64bit offsets from the producer code,
       but allow the DWARF3 extended 64bit offsets if the flag
        DW_DLC_OFFSET_SIZE_64 is turned on in the call to dwarf_producer_init().
     * config.h.in: Provide undefs for the offset macros.

2008-01-25  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * pro_die.c: Changed leading tabs to spaces.
2008-01-23  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * pro_die.c: Using di_last_child field dwarf_die_link
       goes from O(N) to O(1) in adding a child.
       Thanks to Daniel Gollub for the suggestion.
       An omission in linking left/right children is fixed.
       Changed some leading TABs to spaces.
     * pro_opaque.h: Add di_last_child field.
2008-01-14  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Added missing backslash to correct formatting
       error. Thanks to Daniel Golub for pointing out the ommission.
     * libdwarf2.p1.pdf: Regenerated.
