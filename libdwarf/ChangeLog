     * dwarf_print_lines.c: Added commentary to clarify that
       dwarf_print_lines() and _dwarf_print_lines are intentionally
       identical.  Initialized local variables so they are alll
       visibly set to some sensible value.

     * dwarf_frame.c (_dwarf_fde_section_offset): A typo
       in the last release made this an infinite loop.
       A one character change fixed it. Thanks to Carlos Alberto
       Enciso for noticing the bug.

     * dwarf_incl.h, pro_incl.h: Moved #include of dwarf.h before libdwarf.h
     * pro_forms.c: Some newer attributes are now handled.
     * dwarf_print_lines.c: Removed unused #include.
     * dwarf_sort_line.c: Removed alloca use in favor of
       malloc and removed the alloca #include.
     * dwarf_line.c: Removed unused #include.
     * dwarf_line2.c: Removed unused #include.

     * libdwarf.h: Fix commentary mistakes.
2008-02-02  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Add DW_DLC_OFFSET_SIZE_64 for run-time
       selection of DWARF3 64bit extension producer offset generation.
     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Document DW_DLC_OFFSET_SIZE_64.
     * pro_init.c (dwarf_producer_init): Now standard DWARF3 is the default.
     * configure.in: Add --enable-dwarf-format-sgi-irix for those
       wanting IRIX offset-style DWARF2. Add --enable-dwarf-format-strict-32bit
       for those wanting strictly 32bit offsets.
       Otherwise default to generating 64bit offsets from the producer code,
       but allow the DWARF3 extended 64bit offsets if the flag
        DW_DLC_OFFSET_SIZE_64 is turned on in the call to dwarf_producer_init().
     * config.h.in: Provide undefs for the offset macros.

     * pro_die.c: Changed leading tabs to spaces.
2008-01-23  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * pro_die.c: Using di_last_child field dwarf_die_link
       goes from O(N) to O(1) in adding a child.
       Thanks to Daniel Gollub for the suggestion.
       An omission in linking left/right children is fixed.
       Changed some leading TABs to spaces.
     * pro_opaque.h: Add di_last_child field.
2008-01-14  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Added missing backslash to correct formatting
       error. Thanks to Daniel Golub for pointing out the ommission.
     * libdwarf2.p1.pdf: Regenerated.
