      * tag_attr.list dwarf.h: DW_AT_namelist_items is
	wrong, changed to DW_AT_namelist_item

2002-04-29  Stephen Clarke <stephen.clarke@superh.com>
      * dwarfdump.c (main): #ifdef for __CYGWIN__ on open().

2001-06-14  David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>

      * print_sections.c: Calling the new libdwarf function
	dwarf_get_arange_cu_header_offset() so we can print
	the cu header offset for aranges.


2000-07-14  Fred Fish  <fnf@ninemoons.com>
 
      * configure.in (LOCATION_OF_LIBELFHEADER): Fix typo for configure
      variable to be tested and enclose libelf/libelf.h in <>.
      * configure: Regenerated.

      * Makefile.in (install): Install dwarfdump.1 from $(srcdir).

  print_sections.c the DW_CFA_offset_extended print 
	did not multiply by data-alignment factor in the
	-v -v detailed output.
	And the offsets used %2d when the values were
	unsigned int, so now %2u.

	And not all cfa prints of values had
	necessarily a type to match
	%llu or %lld where required. Depended on the size of Dwarf_Signed
	and Dwarf_Unsigned.
	So now explicitly use cast to the
	right type to match the % format.

  print_sections.c - 1.56
        - A single byte of zero is a perfectly legitmate null 
          abbreviation entry          (in .debug_abbrev) 
	 now we print those directly and avoid a warning
          from dwarfdump

  print_die.c - 1.42
        - Explain what combo checker is doing and make it 
	  more maintainable (and fix bug which would 
	  not be hit, but was real enough (in combo checker),
	  using too large a number as highest tag number).

  tag_tree.list - 1.2
        - Add valid parent/child relationships so checker 
	  does not report valid entries as bogus.

  Jason Merrill <jason@cygnus.com> noticed that gcc did
  not like   gcc -E foo.list, so  incorporated his fix so
  now the Makefile.in makes a link and does gcc -E _tmp.c

2000 Jan 26
  elena.demikhovsky@intel.com noticed that 3 statements in
  print_sections.c got warnings from the compiler
  she was using. Simple casts  (provided by her) fixed these.
