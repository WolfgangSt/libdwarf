      * print_sections.c (print_weaknames): Changed
        DW_DLA_TYPENAME to DW_DLA_WEAK at dwarf_dealloc().

2002-10-22  Tom Hughes <thh@cyberscience.com>
      * print_sections.c: macro printing now supported.
      * dwarfdump.c: removed erroneous dwarf_dealloc()
        of string returned by dwarf_errmsg().
 
2002-11-22  David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * dwarf_names.awk at_list.awk: Allow an name to have two 
        spellings so the historical name preserved yet the dwarf3 
        version is supported. First name seen is used/reported
        by dwarfdump.
      * dwarf.h:   DW_TAG_template_type_param(eter)
        DW_TAG_template_value_param(eter) DW_AT_namelist_itm(s)   
        are the ones with alternate spellings now.
        Added Universal Parallel C TAGs/Attributes in
	user namespace.
      * tag_attr.c tag_attr.list tag_tree.c tag_tree.list:
        Use the DW_TAG_template_* dwarf3 spellings.


2002-05-08  David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * tag_attr.list dwarf.h: DW_AT_namelist_items is
	wrong, changed to DW_AT_namelist_item

2002-04-29  Stephen Clarke <stephen.clarke@superh.com>
      * dwarfdump.c (main): #ifdef for __CYGWIN__ on open().

2001-06-14  David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>

      * print_sections.c: Calling the new libdwarf function
	dwarf_get_arange_cu_header_offset() so we can print
	the cu header offset for aranges.


2000-07-14  Fred Fish  <fnf@ninemoons.com>
 
      * configure.in (LOCATION_OF_LIBELFHEADER): Fix typo for configure
      variable to be tested and enclose libelf/libelf.h in <>.
      * configure: Regenerated.
       
2000-07-10  Fred Fish  <fnf@ninemoons.com>
 
      * Makefile.in (install): Install dwarfdump.1 from $(srcdir).

  print_sections.c the DW_CFA_offset_extended print 
	did not multiply by data-alignment factor in the
	-v -v detailed output.
	And the offsets used %2d when the values were
	unsigned int, so now %2u.

	And not all cfa prints of values had
	necessarily a type to match
	%llu or %lld where required. Depended on the size of Dwarf_Signed
	and Dwarf_Unsigned.
	So now explicitly use cast to the
	right type to match the % format.

  print_sections.c - 1.56
        - A single byte of zero is a perfectly legitmate null 
          abbreviation entry          (in .debug_abbrev) 
	 now we print those directly and avoid a warning
          from dwarfdump

  print_die.c - 1.42
        - Explain what combo checker is doing and make it 
	  more maintainable (and fix bug which would 
	  not be hit, but was real enough (in combo checker),
	  using too large a number as highest tag number).

  tag_tree.list - 1.2
        - Add valid parent/child relationships so checker 
	  does not report valid entries as bogus.

  Jason Merrill <jason@cygnus.com> noticed that gcc did
  not like   gcc -E foo.list, so  incorporated his fix so
  now the Makefile.in makes a link and does gcc -E _tmp.c

2000 Jan 26
  elena.demikhovsky@intel.com noticed that 3 statements in
  print_sections.c got warnings from the compiler
  she was using. Simple casts  (provided by her) fixed these.

1999 July 21

  print_sections changed to allow printing
  of dwarf-ish egcs c++ .eh_frame data


1999 June 14
  Fred Fish fnf@ninemoons.com contributed
  autoconf'ing of the libdwarf and dwarfdump source.
