      * print_sections.c (get_fde_proc_name): Initialize some
        local variables at declaration.  The function is very slow
        and needs a replacement.
      * print_die.c:  Fixes a typo in a comment.
      * dwarfdump.c: Added -n option to suppress function name search
        when printing FDEs. Current dwarfdump is n-squared at least
        getting those names, this is a bandage-type-workaround when
        there are so many FDEs the slowness is painful.
      * globals.h: Support for -n option.
      * print_frames.c: Support for -n option.

      * dwarfdump.c: Added -H option for testing
        (it limits the run length).
        And the support for -H in printing DIEs.
      * globals.h: Added extern for -H option declaration.
      * print_sections.c: Added -H option support to limit frames printing.

      * print_die.c (tag_tree_combination, tag_attr_combination):
        Ensure we do not index off the end of the -k checking arrays.
      * print_sections.c: Increase the size of a local variable,.

      * dwarfdump.1: Add description of -ka option.
      * print_frames.h print_sections.c testesb.c print_die.c print_reloc.c
        dwarfdump.c tag_tree.c tag_attr.c esb.c esb.h makename.c dwconf.c
        makename.h dwconf.h globals.h print_frames.c: Change tabs
        to spaces with expand(1).

      * print_die.c: Now check that DW_AT_decl_file
        and DW_AT_call_file indexes are valid and count instances of the
        attribute and errors found in it.
      * dwarfdump.c: With -ka and -ky now check that DW_AT_decl_file
        and DW_AT_call_file indexes are valid and warn if bad.
        Thanks to Carlos Alberto Enciso for the suggestion.
      * globals.h: Declare new fields for the  DW_AT_decl_file
        DW_AT_call_file checks. 
2008-02-26 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_die.c (get_attr_value): Print DW_AT_call_file,
        DW_AT_call_line, DW_AT_call_column nicely.
