  Now we print the .debug_ranges section (with -N) 
  and the data for DW_AT_ranges (with -i).
December 8, 2008
  The -M option now causes printing of FORM details.
  And -v adds details about abbreviation 'indexes' into
  an abbreviation table (.debug_abbrev)
  providing more detail for folks debugging or
  improving their understanding of DWARF data.
April 9, 2008
  Added -H  <num>  to limit the number of compilation-units/FDEs
  dwarfdump prints in one run.  Added -n to eliminate function-name
  printing in .debug_frame output (with a large-enough debug_info
  section function-name printing is too slow). The function name
  printing will be fixed in another release.
December 8, 2007
  Had to add an ugly configure conditional as libelf has
  unconditional use of off64_t in recent libelf.h
July 3, 2007
  Now with -v dwarf expression blocks in frame operations
  are printed expanded out.
July 2, 2007
  Added a new abi -x abi=general usable for any cpu with
  up to 1000 registers.
May 7, 2007
  Sun Microsystems contributes new dwarf.h extensions and a new -G option
  to dwarfdump -i (so one can see the 'global' offset to DIEs).
  Thanks to Chris Quenelle of Sun.
April 17, 2006
  New -x name=<conf file> -x abi=<abiname> and configuration file
  enable sensible printing of a wide range of .debug_frame eh_frame
  correctly without recompiling dwarfdump or touching libdwarf.h or
  dwarf.h.

  Now handles DWARF3. For non-MIPS objects, the list of register
  names in print_sections.c is not appropriate, #define
  DWARFDUMP_TURN_OFF_MIPS_REG_NAMES to turn off the MIPS names.
December 1, 2005
  Added new DWARF3 TAGs and ATtributes to the -k lists,
  clarified the -k reporting, and made the build more robust
  in the face of errors in the *.list relationship-spec-files.

August 1, 2005
  Now print_die.c deals with long loclists without a coredump.
  Added esb.h esb.c (and testesb.c for testing) to encapsulate 
  getting space for possibly-long strings.
  Now print_die.c uses snprintf() not sprintf (hopefully this
  will not inconvenience anyone, snprintf() has been available
  on most systems for years now).
  Altered print of location lists a little bit - for better appearance.

July 15, 2005
  Now completely frees all allocated memory. Various
  routines were not calling dealloc() code and
  new libdwarf dealloc routines are now used where those
  are needed.

  Now prints DWARF3 .debug_pubtypes section (with -a or -y).
  The .debug_pubtypes section and  SGI-specific .debug_typenames
  are equvalent so they are treated alike.

Mar 21, 2005
  The -f flag now prints only .debug_frame data. The .eh_frame section
  (GNU exceptions data) now prints with -F (not -a). 
  Printing gcc 3.3 or 3.4 .eh_frame with zR augmentation
  does not work at this time, so do not use -F
  to print such an object.
  The line section print now prints a CU-DIE offset for each such DIEs
  line information.   This makes it much easier to correctly associate
  -l (or -v -l) output with -v -v -l when debugging a faulty
  linetable in an executable.
  With -v -v -l (two -v) the output of line info continues to be a 
  completely different format than zero or one -v, the two-v
  form showing the detailed line table opcodes.
  With g++ 3.3.3 one sees bad line addresses at times as the 
  DW_LNE_set_address address for header files do not always 
  get their relocations applied.  I am told this is fixed in 3.4.x.


Mar 18, 2005
  In correcting printing of macro information the format
  of the macro (-m) output has changed substantially.
  Much more complete now.  Still could use enhancement.

Oct 28, 2004
  Updated contact address in copyright: SGI moved 1/4 mile
  to a new address: 1500 Crittenden Lane.

Oct 02, 2003
  Now fully supports .debug_loc section.

June 14, 2001
  Now calling a new function dwarf_get_arange_cu_header_offset()
  in libdwarf and printing the returned cu header offset for 
  aranges entries.   Making it easier to track down internal 
  errors in the dwarf2 data.  Also added small other
  consistency checks, printing a message and exit()ing on 
  error.

April 14, 2000
  The libdwarf copyright has changed to
     version 2.1 of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
  Anyone holding a version of libdwarf that was published
              before this new copyright
  is allowed to use
    the copyright published in that earlier libdwarf source
    on the earlier source
  or to use 
    this new copyright on the earlier source,
  at their option.

July 21, 1999
  Added gnu extensions to the frame information printer
  and handling for egcs eh_frame printing.
  libdwarf changes mean this now can print little-endian
  object dwarf on a big-endian system and vice-versa.

December, 1998
  added dwarfdump to the dwarf public source distribution.

June, 1994
  libdwarf consumer interface changed completely so updated to match.

May,  1993
  Initial version of dwarfdump  for dwarf version 2
  written at sgi.
